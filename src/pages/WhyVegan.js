            <div className="vegan-text">A vegan diet consists only of plant-derived foods. It is healthy, nutritionally adequate, and provides health benefits .Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage. Vegans consume a wide variety of foods such as plant-only versions of traditional favorites such as pizza, tacos, burritos, lasagna, burgers, sandwiches, and desserts. Also, Blahaj loves Vegan and definitely insists you to try it!</div>
