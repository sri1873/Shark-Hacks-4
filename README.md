# VEGAN JAWS

### Inspiration 🥕🥑🥗

**Veganism 101** : Help yourself and help Animals. As in todays lifestyle people want healthy living, sustainability and to enjoy their favourite foods without worrying about the fats and calories, a vegan diet is the most suitable one because its completely plant-based. Blahaj loves vegan too because one of his shark mates- the Bonnethead Shark is a vegetarian now and Blahaj wanted to give it a try. A diet that is healthy, tasty and environment-friendly is all we need right now. Go Vegan

### What it does 🍲🧑‍🍳

Vegan Jaws is a Vegan Recipes Website where you can search for any vegan recipe that contains all the ingredients and instructions to cook. It allows you to search for recipes by a specific ingredient too. 

### How we built it ⚒️⚙️

- The website is built using HTML, CSS, React & Javascript for the Frontend. 
- Bootstrap is used for different card layouts for the recipes.
- Designing was done using Adobe-Illustartor.
- It uses a food-API that displays vegan recipes on the request of the recipe name or an ingredient. 

### Challenges we ran into🧑‍💻🧠
- Managing the Food-API and making it run smoothly everytime.
- Coding the CSS for the website was a task as it involved an aesthetic design.
- Working with the daily limitations of the food-API.


### Accomplishments that we're proud of 🙌
